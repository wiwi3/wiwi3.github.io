    <h1>Privacy Policy for Camia</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 2024 June 25</strong></p>

    <p>EforCreative Solutions Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Camia app collects, uses, and protects user data. By using Camia, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Photos and Videos:</strong><br>
       Camia allows users to capture photos and videos using the app's camera functionalities. We <strong>do not</strong> store, share, or use any of the photos or videos captured by users.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. User Information:</strong><br>
       Camia <strong>does not</strong> collect, store, or use any personal information from users. The app operates locally on your device, and all captured media remains on your device unless you choose to share it through other means.
    </p>

    <h3>Third-Party SDKs</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Toast:</strong><br>
       Camia integrates the Toast SDK to provide in-app notifications and messages. Toast may collect certain device information necessary for delivering these services, but it does not collect any personal data or media content from Camia. For more information on how Toast handles data, please refer to the <a href="https://your-toast-privacy-policy-url.com/" target="_blank">Toast Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. GoogleMobileAds:</strong><br>
       Camia uses GoogleMobileAds SDK to serve ads in the app. Google may collect certain non-personal information such as device identifiers and interaction with ads to serve personalized ads. This data is managed according to Google’s privacy policies. For more information, please refer to the <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>3. Firebase Remote Config:</strong><br>
       Camia utilizes Firebase Remote Config to dynamically control app features. Firebase collects non-personally identifiable information such as device identifiers and app usage statistics to deliver and optimize this service. Firebase’s handling of data is governed by Google’s privacy policies. For more details, please refer to the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data. Since Camia does not store or transmit any photos, videos, or personal information, the risk of data breaches is minimized. The app relies on your device's built-in security features to protect your media content.</p>

    <h3>User Rights</h3>
    <p>As Camia does not collect or store personal information, there are no user data rights applicable under this policy. Your photos and videos remain solely on your device, and you have full control over their use and sharing.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>
